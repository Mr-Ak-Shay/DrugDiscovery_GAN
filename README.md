Hey!

This is a Drug Discovery Project, where I have used SMILES notation for molecular structure generation using GAN(General Adversial Network) architecture. 
This project could further be developed by deploying this with a web platform, like Streamlit, Django or somthing else.
I'm currently working on it. 
So, yeah..

Have Fun :)
