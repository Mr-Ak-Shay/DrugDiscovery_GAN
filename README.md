Hey!
(Disclaimer: I have used a very tiny dataset from ChatGPT, to test the model)

This is a Drug Discovery Project, where I have used SMILES notation for molecular structure generation using GAN(General Adversial Network) architecture. 
This model could be scaled, if you would implement a bigger dataset from Kaggle or somewhere else also could be further developed by deploying this with a web platform, like Streamlit, Django or somthing else. 
I'm currently working on it. 
So, yeah..

Have Fun :)
